AtliQ Mart: Supply Chain Service Level Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing and improving the service levels of AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India. Due to recent service issues that led to the loss of key customers, the company seeks to track and enhance their 'On Time' (OT) and 'In Full' (IF) delivery performance. As a new data analyst, the goal is to create a dashboard that provides daily insights into service levels, helping management address issues promptly and support the company's planned expansion to other Tier 1 cities.
